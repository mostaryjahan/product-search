## Overview
The objective of this project is to create a modern and dynamic product gallery that displays product data fetched from a JSON file or a mock API. Users can filter, sort, and search products to find exactly what they're looking for. The layout is fully responsive, making it accessible on devices of all sizes.

## Features

- **Filtering**: Filter products by category and price range.
- **Sorting**: Sort products by price (low-to-high, high-to-low) or by popularity.
- **Search**: Real-time search functionality to find products by name.
- **Responsive Design**: Uses CSS Grid and Flexbox to ensure the gallery is fully responsive.
- **Product Details**: Clicking "View Details" opens a modal with additional product information.
- **Loading State**: Displays a loading spinner while fetching data.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: React, JavaScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for a modern and responsive UI
